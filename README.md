# Nixos Configuration
This is my nixos setup. The current plan is to make it comfortable enough to use for my basic tasks, 
then use for programming. I will try to split the files as small as possible, then import them back in as modules.
I want to use Issues for each new thing to do, to make sure that I keep track of where I am at and what I should 
work on next. This will be updating randomly with explanations and resources I find helpful along the way.

Another thing to note, I don't want to write styling for waybar, so I am making [Claude 4 Opus](https://claude.ai/) 
do it for me. I had to manually tweak it a lot but it did not come out bad. I left the comements it made inside of 
the file.

The rest of the files have been created by me.
